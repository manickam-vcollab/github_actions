System Requirements
====================

The minimum requirements for running VMoveJT  are as follows. 

  - Pentium III Processor or equivalent 
  - 512MB disk space 
  - 512MB RAM 
  - Monitor supporting 800x600 resolution 


These are minimum requirements for running VMoveJT. However, optimal requirements for efficient execution of VMoveJT  depends upon the user processes, esp. the file size and the size of the model. For example, if user routinely processes large files, we recommend a system with the following or better configuration. 

  - Pentium Core 2 Duo or equivalent 

  - 5GB disk space 

  - 2GB RAM 

  - Monitor supporting 800x600 resolution
